What is an anonymous function? Why is it helpful, when to use it.







<body>
<form id="demo">

<input autocomplete="off" auto


</script>



document.getElementById("demo").onsubmit = function() {
    let name = document.getElementById("name").value;
    alert("hello, " + ${name});
}

</script>
</body>


/*the ananymous function only runs onsubmit (useful af)*/
/*call greet but dont use the () because you dont want the code to run until its called (only onsubmit). */
